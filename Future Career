  <h1>Game Drawing</h1>
  <p>My future career that I want to perue is Game drawing. I want to draw characters or items on paper and give it to computer 
  drawers. Game drawing doesn't have any requirements, but years of school are prefered. Employers prefer people with 3-5 years 
  in game art. Also, it is prefered that they take classes in modeling and animation, color theory, interface design, level design,
  scene design and illustration. The salaries for game artists is usually $30,000 annually for entry-level art positions, but they
  can grow to as much as $90,000 per year, and even higher for lead positions. Locations for this job can be anywhere a gaming company 
  is located. An outline plan for this job includes many different art classes. Drawers should take multiple classes to see what 
  style/type of art they are best at.</p>
