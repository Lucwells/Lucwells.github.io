<h1><b>Luc Wells</b></h1>
<p>I am a 14 year old CCA highscool freshman. I have 3 pets, a cat and 2 chickens. I have 2 siblings, an older brother and a younger sister.
On my free time, I like to be with friends, play video games, or draw. My favorite animal is either a tiger or a panther. I am about 6 feet 
tall. I have blonde hair and blue/gray eyes.</p>
